# How to Build a Sustainable React Application? Encapsulation, Auto Code Generation, and Form Structure

Welcome to the **Pet Shop Example Project** üè®‚Äîa showcase of best practices for building **sustainable React applications**. This project demonstrates:

- **File Structure:** A feature-first organization for scalable and maintainable code.
- **API Integration:** Using TypeScript and Axios with schema-based code generation for clean and efficient API calls.
- **Forms:** A modular and reusable form setup powered by Zod and React Hook Form.

## Features

### üóÇ Feature-Based File Structure
The project is organized by feature, promoting encapsulation and scalability. Each feature includes its own components, hooks, and logic.

### üîÑ API Integration
APIs are generated automatically using **OpenAPI Generator** for:
- Type safety
- Reduced boilerplate
- Seamless integration

### üìà Modular Forms
Forms are designed with:
- Zod for schema-based validation
- React Hook Form for lightweight and powerful form state management
- Type-safe and reusable field components

## Tech Stack

- **React**: UI development
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and scalability
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management
- **Zod**: Schema validation
- **Axios**: API requests
- **OpenAPI Generator**: Automated API client generation
